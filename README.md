Quest Schedule Exporter
======================

This tool allows University of Waterloo students 
to export their schedules from Quest to any calendar
they like! It produces an iCalender file which 
can then be imported anywhere!

If it doesn't work for you, feel free to download it,
run it on your own PHP 7 server and fix the bug!
All contributions and bug reports welcome! Just don't tell me
my style is bad or the file is ugly because I already know that.
I might decide to make it pretty, but it's just one of those hacks
that doesn't need to be clean.
